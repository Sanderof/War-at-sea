# War-at-sea
Upload of my first HTML5 Canvas game made in 2017.

# Game objective
The game's objective is simply to shoot down as many planes and helicopters as possible in five waves of enemies without dying.

# Game controls
Left and right arrow keys: Move the ship left or right.

A and D keys: Move the ship's canon left or right.

W key: Fire weapon

1 key: Select rockets as weapon

2 key: Select machine gun as weapon

0 key: Sound on/off

Return key: Pause/resume game

Esc: Exit to main menu

# General
The game is written in vanilla Javascript using functional programming.

I do not own any of the sound effects or the music. Neither do I own the rights to the background image (Sky and grass).

The other sprites (e.g. helicopter, ship, rockets, meny buttons) are however self-made.
